# Fetch Rewards Take-Home Assessment

Greetings! To complete my assessment, I created this app with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), along with some extra help from [Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) for some notification handling.

## How to Start

Please fork and clone this project, after doing so, run with:

### `npm start`

This will open the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default browser.

## Usage

Compete the form that will open on your screen. If you fill out each field, you will see a notification pop up at the top of your screen for a successful form submission.
However, if you leave any fields blank, you'll be alerted that you need to fill out the empty fields before submitting.
